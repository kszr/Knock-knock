# Knock-knock

Do people who forget to lock the bathroom door have a higher chance of being walked in on if the door has "vacant" or "occupied" written on it?
 
Assumptions (A is in the bathroom, and B is outside):
1. If B knocks while A is inside, A will always say, "Occupied!" so B will never walk in on him.
1. If the door reads "occupied", B will never knock.
1. If the door reads "vacant" or if there are no indicators on the door, B may or may not knock. The chances of B's knocking if the door says vacant are lower than the chances of his knocking if the door doesn't say anything at all.

Note that, inasmuch as this simulation begins with the assumption that a person is more likely to knock if there are no signs on the bathroom door, it doesn't contribute anything extraordinary to the human understanding, other than to show that the probability of walking in on someone is inversely related to the probability of knocking.
